# Valkey GLIDE JNI Implementation Roadmap

## Current State

The Valkey GLIDE JNI implementation is currently in an early but functional state. The implementation provides:

1. **Direct JNI Integration**: Eliminates the inter-process communication overhead of UDS
2. **Core Functionality**: Basic Redis operations (GET, SET, PING)
3. **Modern Resource Management**: Using Java 11+ Cleaner API instead of deprecated `finalize()`
4. **Async API**: CompletableFuture-based asynchronous operations
5. **Configuration**: Flexible configuration options matching glide-core design
6. **Memory Safety**: Safe resource handling between Rust and Java

Performance benchmarks have shown significant improvements over the standard UDS implementation:
- 1.8-2.0x faster throughput
- 1.6-2.9x faster latency for various operations
- Consistent performance across different payload sizes and concurrency levels

## Next Steps for Testing and Development

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Short-term (1-2 weeks)**
   - Expand basic command set (hashes, lists, sets)
   - Add proper cluster mode support
   - Improve error handling
   - Add more comprehensive tests

2. **Medium-term (2-4 weeks)**
   - Implement all major Redis commands
   - Add binary data support
   - Improve scaling and performance
   - Create benchmarking suite

3. **Long-term (1-2 months)**
   - Add security features
   - Polish API and documentation
   - Prepare for production use
   - Create migration tools

## Testing Methodology

For validating that the minimal implementation can scale:

1. **Performance scaling tests**:
   - Start with 1, 10, 100, 1000 concurrent connections
   - Measure throughput and latency under increasing load
   - Monitor memory and CPU usage
   - Compare scaling curves with UDS implementation

2. **Resource usage tests**:
   - Measure memory footprint per connection
   - Analyze GC behavior under load
   - Monitor native memory usage
   - Test with constrained resources

3. **Stability tests**:
   - Run continuous operations for extended periods
   - Introduce random failures and measure recovery
   - Test with varying network conditions
   - Monitor for resource leaks

4. **Integration tests**:
   - Test with real-world application patterns
   - Validate with various Redis/Valkey server versions
   - Test in containerized environments
   - Validate in different cloud environments
