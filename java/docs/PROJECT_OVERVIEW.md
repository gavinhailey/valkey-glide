# JNI Implementation Project Overview

## Goal

Replace the current UDS (Unix Domain Socket) implementation with a high-performance JNI-based direct integration while maintaining complete API compatibility with existing Valkey GLIDE Java clients.

## Key Objectives

1. **Performance**: Achieve significant performance improvements by eliminating IPC overhead
2. **Compatibility**: Maintain 100% API compatibility with existing Java client interfaces
3. **Maintainability**: Create a scalable architecture that supports all server commands
4. **Reliability**: Ensure proper resource management and error handling

## Architecture Comparison

### Current UDS Architecture
```
Java Client â†’ UDS Socket â†’ Standalone Rust Process â†’ glide-core â†’ Valkey
```

### Target JNI Architecture
```
Java Client â†’ JNI â†’ glide-core (in-process) â†’ Valkey
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Performance Baseline and Analysis âœ…
- Establish performance baseline for UDS implementation
- Analyze code structure and identify integration points
- Create benchmark and testing infrastructure
- Document key interfaces to preserve

### Phase 2: Core JNI Integration âœ…
- Design and implement generic command execution system
- Create unified JNI interface for all server commands
- Implement comprehensive type conversion system
- Build robust testing framework

### Phase 3: Direct Replacement Implementation âœ… **COMPLETE**
- âœ… Replace CommandManager UDS logic with JNI calls
- âœ… Update ConnectionManager for JNI-based connections
- âœ… Maintain exact API compatibility with existing interfaces
- âœ… **22 core Redis operations implemented in BaseClient**
- âœ… **Batch operations with BaseBatch support**
- âœ… **Build system working with successful compilation**

### Phase 4: Enhanced Features ðŸ”„ **NEXT PHASE**
- [ ] Implement atomic transactions (MULTI/EXEC/DISCARD/WATCH)
- [ ] Re-implement Lua scripting support (EVAL/EVALSHA)
- [ ] Add cluster mode support (GlideClusterClient)
- [ ] Implement advanced commands (sets, sorted sets, streams)

### Phase 5: Cross-Platform Support
- [ ] Build pipeline for multi-platform native libraries
- [ ] JDK 8 compatibility layer
- [ ] Platform-specific optimizations

### Phase 5: Testing and Validation
In order to test and validate we will use the existing test suite which will give us:
- Comprehensive integration testing
- Backward compatibility verification
In addition we will create performance deep tests and security tests to ensure:
- Memory safety and resource management
- High performance implementation
- Cross-platform compatibility checks
For security we will use:
- Static analysis tools
- Dynamic analysis tools
- Fuzz testing for JNI interfaces
- Security audits for native code
For performance we will use:
- Benchmarking scripts to compare with UDS implementation
- Profiling tools to identify bottlenecks
- Load testing to validate throughput and latency improvements
For Fuzz testing we will use:
- AFL (American Fuzzy Lop) for native code fuzzing
- LibFuzzer for targeted JNI interface fuzzing

### Phase 6: Finalization
- Remove UDS-specific components
- Documentation updates
- Release preparation

## Performance Targets

Based on Phase 1 benchmarks, the JNI implementation targets:
- **Throughput**: 1.68x improvement (74k â†’ 124k+ TPS)
- **Average Latency**: 1.69x reduction (1.34ms â†’ 0.80ms)
- **P99 Latency**: 2.79x reduction (5.45ms â†’ 1.96ms)
